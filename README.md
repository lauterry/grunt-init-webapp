## Why is grunt-init-webapp awesome ?
* Interactive way to scaffold your web app project to fit your needs. You need to lint your CSS ? Just answer a few questions asked to you by `grunt-init-webapp`
* You assets dependencies are handled by [bower](http://www.bower.io)
* Do not handle manually one index.html for development and one index.html for production thanks to [grunt-usemin](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin)
  Automatically replace your scripts and stylesheets declaration by the minified version when packaging your app for production.
* Watch for you assets changes to automatically run `jshint` or `csslint` on your code
* Livereload is out of the box. No more F5
* Automatically output a hash in your assets file name for caching purpose.
